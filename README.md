## Naive Bayes Classifier

A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model thatâ€™s used for classification task. The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem.

Using Bayes theorem, we can find the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. Here, B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. The assumption made here is that the predictors/features are independent. That is presence of one particular feature does not affect the other. 

Naive Bayes algorithms are mostly used in sentiment analysis, spam filtering, recommendation systems etc. They are fast and easy to implement but their biggest disadvantage is that the requirement of predictors to be independent. In most of the real life cases, the predictors are dependent, this hinders the performance of the classifier.
